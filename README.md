# Archimedes Shop Front-End Template

Welcome to the Archimedes Shop front-end template! This is a learning project created by me (Archimedes-314) to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is not a fully functional online shop, but a template for front-end development practice.

## Project Overview

- **What is this**?
This is a basic front-end template for a fictional shop themed after Archimedes. It includes several simple pages (homepage, product listings, contact), but has no backend functionality (no database, payments, or third-party integration).

- **Why is this project here**?
The goal is to provide a practice project for learning front-end skills and web development.

## Important Notes

- **No Backend**: This template is for front-end practice only. It does not support shopping carts, payments, or any backend/business operations. For a real e-commerce site, you’ll need to add backend features yourself.
- **Learning Use Only**: This repository is for experimentation and learning. If you adapt the code for real use, you are responsible for adding backend services as needed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- CSS: Responsible for the styling and layout of the pages.
- JavaScript: Used to add basic interactivity, such as forms or dynamic elements.
- Python: Used to create simple animations.
- TeX: Used to create PDF documents.
